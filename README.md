## Spring 2019 - Project for Probabilistic Modelling
## "How a Bayesian Hierarchical Model makes our roads safer"

### [Project Description](doc/)

+ This project was conducted by Gururaj M. Desai, Eda D. Özdemir, Tim R. Schleicher

+ Project summary: We conducted an in-depth project on the paper "A novel Bayesian hierarchical model for road safety hotspot prediction" by Fawcett, Thorpe, Matthews & Kremer (2017). The model introduced by Fawcett et al. intends to enable practitioners to take proactive road safety measures at specific sites by predicting the number of accidents and ranking them according to their safety hotspot potentials. In contrast to previous models, the confounding effects of regressionto-
mean and trend are met. Aim of this study project was to analyze the model and to replicate it based on historical data of accident counts from the German city of Halle. As indicated in detail throughout the project report, we were able to successfully replicate the model.

+ Contribution statement: All authors contributed extensively to the project. The success of the project is due to equally large contributions by all three authors in terms of time and task complexity. In joint discussions, the authors developed the main conceptual ideas on how to tackle the overall model replication, how to frame the two presentations, and how to structure the report. At the same time, certain areas of focus were defined: EÖ focused especially on the bigger picture, the impact of the research, communication with the original authors and the data. With the help of EÖ and TS, GD concentrated on coding the model, looking for opportunities on how to improve it, and further technical details. TS focused predominantly on the theory behind the model and its analysis, the model comparisons, creating a structure for the presentations and the report. GD and
EÖ put special attention on interpreting the analysis, while TS helped on how to convey the content to the audience/reader. All authors helped in verifying the numerical results by an independent implementation of certain steps in the R language. In addition, all authors discussed the results, commented extensively, and developed an outlook.
